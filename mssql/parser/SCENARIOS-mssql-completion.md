# MSSQL SQL Autocompletion Scenarios

> Goal: Implement parser-native SQL autocompletion for MSSQL, matching PG/MySQL architecture — parser instrumentation with collectMode, completion module with Complete(sql, cursor, catalog) API
> Verification: Table-driven Go tests — Complete(sql, cursorPos, catalog) returns expected candidates with correct types
> Reference: PG completion (pg/completion/, pg/parser/complete.go), MySQL completion (mysql/completion/)
> Out of scope (v1): Service Broker, Resource Governor, Availability Groups, Endpoints, Full-text search, DBCC, BULK INSERT, CLR Assembly, XML Schema, External Tables

Status legend: `[ ]` pending, `[x]` passing, `[~]` partial

## Phase 1: Parser Completion Infrastructure

### 1.1 Completion Mode Fields & Entry Point

- [x] Parser struct has completion fields: completing bool, cursorOff int, candidates *CandidateSet, collecting bool, maxCollect int
- [x] collectMode() returns true when completing && collecting
- [x] checkCursor() sets collecting=true when p.cur.Loc >= cursorOff
- [x] CandidateSet struct with Tokens []int, Rules []RuleCandidate, seen/seenR dedup maps
- [x] RuleCandidate struct with Rule string (e.g., "columnref", "table_ref")
- [x] addTokenCandidate(tokType int) adds to CandidateSet.Tokens with dedup
- [x] addRuleCandidate(rule string) adds to CandidateSet.Rules with dedup
- [x] errCollecting sentinel error for unwinding parser stack
- [x] Collect(sql string, cursorOffset int) *CandidateSet — entry point with panic recovery
- [x] Collect returns non-nil CandidateSet even for empty input
- [x] All existing parser tests pass with completion fields present (completing=false)

### 1.2 TokenName & Basic Keyword Collection

- [x] TokenName(tokType int) returns SQL keyword string for token type
- [x] TokenName handles single-char tokens (';', '(', ')', ',', etc.)
- [x] TokenName handles all 221 MSSQL keywords
- [x] Empty input → keyword candidates for all top-level statements
- [x] After semicolon → keyword candidates for new statement
- [x] Cursor at EOF of empty string → top-level keywords (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.)

### 1.3 Statement-Level Dispatch Instrumentation

- [x] `|` (empty) → top-level statement keywords (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, MERGE, WITH, EXEC, DECLARE, SET, IF, WHILE, BEGIN, PRINT, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, TRUNCATE, USE, BACKUP, RESTORE)
- [x] `CREATE |` → object type keywords (TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, TRIGGER, DATABASE, SCHEMA, TYPE, SEQUENCE, SYNONYM, STATISTICS, LOGIN, USER, ROLE)
- [x] `ALTER |` → object type keywords (TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, TRIGGER, DATABASE, SCHEMA, SEQUENCE, LOGIN, USER, ROLE)
- [x] `DROP |` → object type keywords (TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, TRIGGER, DATABASE, SCHEMA, TYPE, SEQUENCE, SYNONYM, STATISTICS, LOGIN, USER, ROLE, IF)
- [x] Build passes after 1.3

---

## Phase 2: Completion Module (API & Resolution)

### 2.1 Public API & Core Logic

- [x] mssql/completion/ package exists
- [x] Complete(sql, cursorOffset, catalog) returns []Candidate
- [x] Candidate struct has Text, Type (CandidateType), Definition, Comment fields
- [x] CandidateType enum: Keyword, Schema, Table, View, Column, Function, Procedure, Index, Trigger, Sequence, Type, Login, User, Role
- [x] Complete with nil catalog returns keyword-only candidates
- [x] Complete with empty sql returns top-level statement keywords
- [x] Prefix filtering: `SEL|` matches SELECT keyword
- [x] Prefix filtering is case-insensitive
- [x] Deduplication: same candidate not returned twice

### 2.2 Candidate Resolution

- [x] Token candidates → keyword strings (from TokenName mapping)
- [x] "table_ref" rule → catalog tables + views
- [x] "columnref" rule → columns from tables in scope
- [x] "schema_ref" rule → catalog schemas
- [x] "func_name" rule → catalog functions + built-in function names
- [x] "proc_ref" rule → catalog procedures
- [x] "index_ref" rule → indexes from relevant table
- [x] "trigger_ref" rule → catalog triggers
- [x] "type_name" rule → T-SQL type keywords (INT, VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, TEXT, DATETIME, DECIMAL, BIT, etc.)
- [x] "database_ref" rule → catalog databases
- [x] "sequence_ref" rule → catalog sequences
- [x] "login_ref" rule → catalog logins
- [x] "user_ref" rule → catalog users
- [x] "role_ref" rule → catalog roles

### 2.3 Table Reference Extraction

- [x] Extract table refs from simple SELECT: `SELECT * FROM t` → [{Table: "t"}]
- [x] Extract table refs with alias: `SELECT * FROM t AS x` → [{Table: "t", Alias: "x"}]
- [x] Extract table refs from JOIN: `FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON ...` → [{Table: "t1"}, {Table: "t2"}]
- [x] Extract table refs with schema: `FROM dbo.t` → [{Schema: "dbo", Table: "t"}]
- [x] Extract table refs from UPDATE: `UPDATE t SET ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
- [x] Extract table refs from INSERT: `INSERT INTO t ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
- [x] Extract table refs from DELETE: `DELETE FROM t ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
- [x] Extract table refs from MERGE: `MERGE INTO t ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
- [x] Fallback to lexer-based extraction when AST parsing fails

### 2.4 Tricky Completion (Fallback)

- [x] Incomplete SQL: `SELECT * FROM ` (trailing space) → insert placeholder, re-collect
- [x] Truncated mid-keyword: `SELE` → prefix-filter against keywords
- [x] Truncated after comma: `SELECT a,` → insert placeholder column
- [x] Truncated after operator: `WHERE a >` → insert placeholder expression
- [x] Multiple placeholder strategies tried in order
- [x] Fallback returns best-effort results when no strategy succeeds
