# MSSQL Parser Position Tracking (Loc) Scenarios

> Goal: Bring MSSQL parser position tracking to full parity with PG parser — accurate Token.End, correct Loc.End on all AST nodes, public API with line:column, sentinel value alignment
> Verification: `go build ./mssql/... && go test ./mssql/... -count=1`; Loc accuracy tests verify `sql[node.Loc.Start:node.Loc.End]` matches expected text
> Reference sources: PG parser (`pg/parser/lexer.go` Token.End, `pg/parser/parser.go` p.prev.End, `pg/parse.go` Statement/Position/lineIndex)

Status: [ ] pending, [x] passing, [~] partial (needs upstream change)

## Phase 1: Foundation

Lexer and parser infrastructure changes that all subsequent phases depend on.

### 1.1 Token End Position

- [x] Token struct has `End int` field (exclusive byte offset past token end)
- [x] Lexer sets `Token.End` to lexer position after consuming each token
- [x] EOF token has `End == Loc` (zero-length)
- [x] Single-char tokens (`;`, `(`, `)`) have `End == Loc + 1`
- [x] Multi-char operators (`<=`, `>=`, `<>`, `!=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `!<`, `!>`, `::`) have correct End
- [x] Integer literals have correct End (`123` → End = Loc + 3)
- [x] Hex literals have correct End (`0xFF` → End = Loc + 4)
- [x] Scientific notation literals have correct End (`1.5e10` → End = Loc + 6)
- [x] String literals include quotes in range (`'hello'` → End = Loc + 7)
- [x] Escaped quotes in strings have correct End (`'it''s'` → End = Loc + 7)
- [x] N-string literals include prefix (`N'hello'` → End = Loc + 8)
- [x] Identifiers have correct End (`myTable` → End = Loc + 7)
- [x] Quoted identifiers include brackets (`[my col]` → End = Loc + 8)
- [x] Double-quoted identifiers include quotes (`"my col"` → End = Loc + 8)
- [x] Escaped brackets in identifiers have correct End (`[col]]name]` → correct End)
- [x] Keywords have correct End (`SELECT` → End = Loc + 6)
- [x] Variables include @ prefix (`@var` → End = Loc + 4)
- [x] System variables include @@ prefix (`@@ROWCOUNT` → End = Loc + 10)
- [x] Float literals have correct End (`3.14` → End = Loc + 4)
- [x] Whitespace/comments are skipped — next token Loc starts after them

### 1.2 Sentinel Value Alignment

- [x] Loc struct uses -1 for "unknown" (not 0)
- [x] `NoLoc()` helper returns `Loc{Start: -1, End: -1}`
- [x] Existing AST node Loc defaults updated (0 → -1 where "not set")
- [~] Nodes that never get explicit Loc assignment use Go zero-value `Loc{}` which equals `NoLoc()` (-1, -1) — impossible: Go zero-value is `{0,0}`, not `{-1,-1}`; use explicit `NoLoc()` where needed
- [x] All existing tests pass with new sentinel value

### 1.3 Parser Prev.End Infrastructure

- [x] Parser `advance()` preserves full Token (including End) in `p.prev`
- [x] New `p.prevEnd()` helper returns `p.prev.End`
- [x] `p.pos()` still returns `p.cur.Loc` (start of current token, unchanged)
- [x] Build passes with infrastructure in place

---

## Phase 5: Public API Wrapper

### 5.1 Statement & Position Types

- [x] `mssql/parse.go` exists with `Statement` struct (Text, AST, ByteStart, ByteEnd, Start, End)
- [x] `Position` struct with `Line int` (1-based) and `Column int` (1-based, byte offset)
- [x] `Statement.Text` contains the SQL text for one statement (including trailing semicolon)
- [x] `Statement.AST` contains the parsed AST node
- [x] `Statement.ByteStart` is inclusive start byte offset in original SQL
- [x] `Statement.ByteEnd` is exclusive end byte offset in original SQL

### 5.2 Line Index Infrastructure

- [x] `buildLineIndex(sql)` returns slice of byte offsets where each line starts
- [x] Line index handles empty string (single entry: 0)
- [x] Line index handles no newlines (single entry: 0)
- [x] Line index handles multiple newlines (`\n` at various positions)
- [x] Line index handles trailing newline
- [x] `offsetToPosition(idx, offset)` returns correct Position via binary search
- [x] Offset 0 → `Position{Line: 1, Column: 1}`
- [x] Offset at start of line N → `Position{Line: N, Column: 1}`
- [x] Offset mid-line → correct column calculation
- [x] Offset past end of input → reasonable behavior (last line, past-end column)

### 5.3 Parse() Function

- [x] `Parse(sql string) ([]Statement, error)` is the public entry point
- [x] Calls `parser.Parse()` internally
- [x] Builds line index once for entire SQL input
- [x] Each statement gets correct ByteStart/ByteEnd from AST Loc
- [x] Each statement gets correct Start/End Position (line:column)
- [x] Multi-statement SQL splits correctly (`SELECT 1; SELECT 2`)
- [x] Statement.Text includes trailing semicolon when present
- [x] Empty input returns empty slice, no error
- [x] Single statement without semicolon works
- [x] Error from parser is propagated correctly

## Phase 6: Loc Accuracy Verification Tests

### 6.1 DML Loc Verification

- [x] `SELECT col FROM t` — SelectStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `SELECT a, b FROM t WHERE x = 1 ORDER BY a` — SelectStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `INSERT INTO t (a) VALUES (1)` — InsertStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `UPDATE t SET a = 1 WHERE b = 2` — UpdateStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `DELETE FROM t WHERE a = 1` — DeleteStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `MERGE INTO t USING s ON t.id = s.id WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET a = s.a` — MergeStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `WITH cte AS (SELECT 1) SELECT * FROM cte` — top-level Loc spans full CTE+SELECT
- [x] `SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id` — JoinClause Loc spans join clause

### 6.2 DDL Loc Verification

- [x] `CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b VARCHAR(50))` — CreateTableStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `CREATE INDEX ix ON t (a)` — CreateIndexStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT 1` — CreateViewStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `CREATE PROCEDURE p AS SELECT 1` — CreateProcedureStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `ALTER TABLE t ADD c INT` — AlterTableStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `DROP TABLE t` — DropStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `CREATE FUNCTION f() RETURNS INT AS BEGIN RETURN 1 END` — CreateFunctionStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `CREATE TRIGGER tr ON t FOR INSERT AS SELECT 1` — CreateTriggerStmt Loc spans full statement
- [x] `TRUNCATE TABLE t` — TruncateStmt Loc spans full statement

### 6.3 Expression & Sub-node Loc Verification

- [x] `SELECT CASE WHEN 1=1 THEN 'a' ELSE 'b' END` — CaseExpr Loc spans CASE..END
- [x] `SELECT a + b` — BinaryExpr Loc spans `a + b`
- [x] `SELECT -x` — UnaryExpr Loc spans `-x`
- [x] `SELECT COALESCE(a, b, c)` — FuncCall Loc spans full call

- [x] `SELECT TRY_CAST(1 AS VARCHAR)` — TryCastExpr Loc spans full expression
- [x] `SELECT TRY_CONVERT(INT, '1')` — TryConvertExpr Loc spans full expression

### 6.4 Multi-Statement & Edge Cases

- [x] `SELECT 1; SELECT 2` — each statement has non-overlapping Loc ranges
- [x] Multi-line SQL — Loc byte offsets account for newlines correctly
- [x] Statement with leading whitespace — Loc.Start points to first keyword, not whitespace
- [x] Statement with trailing semicolon — Loc.End points past the semicolon or past the last token (consistent choice)
- [x] Empty statement (bare semicolons `;;`) — handled without panic
- [x] Very long single-line SQL — positions remain accurate
- [x] Statement ending with block comment — `SELECT 1 /* comment */; SELECT 2` — Loc.End behavior is consistent
- [x] GO batch separator — Loc tracking works correctly across GO-separated batches
- [x] Error-path Loc — nodes parsed before a syntax error have valid Loc; incomplete nodes get NoLoc

### 6.5 Public API Line:Column Tests

- [x] Single-line `SELECT 1` → Start = {1,1}, End past statement
- [x] Two-line `SELECT\n1` → correct line breaks
- [x] Multi-statement multi-line → each statement has correct Start/End positions
- [x] Tab characters count as 1 column (byte-based, not visual)
- [x] Unicode content — column is byte offset, not character count
- [x] `Parse("")` returns empty slice with no error
- [x] `Parse("SELECT 1")` returns one Statement with correct positions
- [x] `Parse("SELECT 1; SELECT 2; SELECT 3")` returns three Statements
