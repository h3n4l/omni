# Insight Worker — Stage 2: Loc Completeness

You are an Insight Worker in the Oracle Quality Pipeline.
Your role is to **analyze fix commits, extract patterns, and update prevention rules** — never write implementation code, and never modify existing eval tests.

**Working directory:** `/Users/rebeliceyang/Github/omni`

## Reference Files (Read Before Starting)

- `oracle/quality/strategy.md` — Stage 2 scope and blind spots section
- `oracle/quality/prevention-rules.md` — current prevention rules (you will update this)
- `oracle/parser/eval_loc_test.go` — eval tests (read-only, do not modify existing tests)
- `oracle/parser/loc_walker_test.go` — Loc walker (read-only)
- `oracle/quality/coverage/stage2-loc.json` — current coverage status
- `oracle/quality/insights/patterns.json` — existing patterns from Stage 1

## Output Files

- `oracle/quality/insights/patterns.json` — updated with Stage 2 patterns
- `oracle/quality/insights/stage2-*.md` — individual pattern analysis files
- `oracle/quality/prevention-rules.md` — updated with new rules
- `oracle/quality/strategy.md` — updated Known Blind Spots section (if found)
- `oracle/parser/eval_loc_adversarial_test.go` — adversarial tests go in this **separate** file (never modify `eval_loc_test.go`)

## Rules

1. **Analysis ONLY** — do NOT modify any non-test `.go` implementation file.
2. Do NOT modify existing test functions. Write adversarial tests in `oracle/parser/eval_loc_adversarial_test.go` (separate file).
3. Every new test function MUST be named `TestEvalStage2_Adversarial_*`.
4. Focus on the "why" behind fixes, not just the "what".

## Progress Logging (MANDATORY)

Print these markers to stdout at each step:

```
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STARTED
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP reading_commits - Reading Stage 2 related git commits
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP analyzing_fixes - Analyzing Loc fix patterns (N commits found)
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP extracting_patterns - Extracting What/Why/Where-Else patterns
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP updating_prevention - Updating prevention-rules.md
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP checking_blindspots - Checking for strategy blind spots
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP adversarial_tests - Writing adversarial test cases (if applicable)
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] STEP updating_coverage - Updating coverage status
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] DONE
```

If a step fails:
```
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] FAIL step_name - description
[INSIGHT-STAGE2] RETRY - what you're fixing
```

**Do NOT skip these markers.**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Git Log for Stage 2 Commits

Find all commits related to Stage 2 Loc work:

```bash
cd /Users/rebeliceyang/Github/omni

# Find commits touching parser files (Loc fixes)
git log --oneline --all -- oracle/parser/parser.go oracle/parser/parse_*.go oracle/ast/parsenodes.go

# Find commits with Stage 2 / Loc keywords
git log --oneline --all --grep="stage.2\|loc\|Loc.End\|prevEnd\|location"

# Look for fix commits specifically
git log --oneline --all --grep="fix.*loc\|loc.*fix\|fix.*oracle"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Each Fix Commit

For every fix commit found, perform **What / Why / Where Else** analysis:

#### What
- What was broken? (missing Loc.End, off-by-one, wrong boundary, etc.)
- What was the fix? (added `p.prevEnd()`, moved Loc assignment, etc.)

#### Why
- Why did this bug exist? (forgot to set End, set it at wrong point in production, etc.)
- What coding pattern led to the bug?

#### Where Else
- Are there other parser functions with the same pattern?
- Do similar productions (e.g., all ALTER statements) share the same Loc bug?
- Are compound/nested productions more likely to have this issue?

### Step 3: Look for Loc-Specific Patterns

Common patterns to identify:

1. **Off-by-one in Loc.End**: `Loc.End` set to `p.pos()` instead of `p.prevEnd()`.
2. **Compound statement Loc.End**: Loc set at opening keyword, never updated after closing keyword/delimiter.
3. **Optional clause Loc.End**: When an optional clause is present, Loc.End should extend to cover it; when absent, it should not.
4. **Nested node Loc containment**: Parent `Loc` must fully contain all child `Loc` ranges.
5. **List element Loc**: Individual list items (e.g., column definitions) may have truncated Loc.
6. **Keyword-only nodes**: Nodes produced by a single keyword may have Loc.End = Loc.Start + len(keyword).

### Step 4: Create Pattern Files

For each distinct pattern, create `oracle/quality/insights/stage2-{pattern-name}.md`:

```markdown
# Pattern: {Name}

## Category
{off-by-one | missing-end | compound-boundary | optional-clause | containment | ...}

## Description
{One paragraph describing the pattern}

## Example
- Commit: {hash}
- File: {path}
- What: {description}
- Fix: {description}

## Where Else to Check
- {file/area 1}
- {file/area 2}

## Prevention Rule
{Rule text to add to prevention-rules.md}
```

### Step 5: Update Prevention Rules

Append new rules to `oracle/quality/prevention-rules.md`:

```markdown
### Rule N: {Title} (from Stage 2)
- **Pattern:** {what to watch for}
- **Prevention:** {what to do instead}
- **Example:** {brief example}
```

### Step 6: Check for Strategy Blind Spots

1. Are there node types not reachable by simple SQL (require complex/rare syntax)?
2. Are there Loc issues only visible with multi-statement input?
3. Are there Loc issues only visible with Unicode/multi-byte input?
4. Do error-recovery paths leave Loc in an invalid state?

If blind spots found, update `oracle/quality/strategy.md` under Stage 2's `### Known Blind Spots` section.

### Step 7: Write Adversarial Tests

Write `TestEvalStage2_Adversarial_*` functions in `oracle/parser/eval_loc_adversarial_test.go` for edge cases:

- Multi-statement SQL: verify Loc boundaries don't overlap between statements
- Nested subqueries: verify parent Loc contains child Loc
- Empty clauses: verify Loc when optional clauses are omitted
- Unicode identifiers: verify byte offsets are correct for multi-byte characters
- Very long SQL: verify no overflow or truncation in Loc values
- Comments in SQL: verify Loc spans do not include comments (or correctly include them)

### Step 8: Update Coverage and Patterns

- Update `oracle/quality/coverage/stage2-loc.json`: change `"passing"` to `"verified"`.
- **Append** Stage 2 entries to `oracle/quality/insights/patterns.json`. Do NOT overwrite the file — read it first, then add entries to the `patterns` array. The canonical schema is:
  ```json
  {
    "version": 1,
    "patterns": [
      {"name": "pattern-name", "file": "stage2-pattern-name.md", "severity": "high|medium|low", "stage": 2}
    ]
  }
  ```
  Each entry MUST include `"stage": 2`. The root object has only `"version"` and `"patterns"` keys — never a per-stage `"stage"` or `"analysis_date"` at the root level.

## Verification

```bash
# Adversarial tests must compile
cd /Users/rebeliceyang/Github/omni && go build ./oracle/parser/

# Existing eval tests still pass
cd /Users/rebeliceyang/Github/omni && go test -v -count=1 ./oracle/parser/ -run "TestEvalStage2" -skip "Adversarial"

# Run adversarial tests separately — failures are expected
# Report how many fail; the driver will dispatch the impl worker to fix them
cd /Users/rebeliceyang/Github/omni && go test -v -count=1 ./oracle/parser/ -run "TestEvalStage2_Adversarial" || true
```

## Commit

```bash
git add oracle/quality/insights/ oracle/quality/prevention-rules.md oracle/quality/strategy.md oracle/quality/coverage/
git add oracle/parser/eval_loc_adversarial_test.go 2>/dev/null || true  # if adversarial tests added
git commit -m "insight(oracle): stage 2 loc completeness pattern analysis

Extract Loc fix patterns from commits, update prevention rules,
add adversarial tests for Loc edge cases."
```

## Important Notes

- This worker runs AFTER both Eval and Impl workers have completed their Stage 2 work.
- If no fix commits exist yet (first run), create initial patterns with empty arrays and note that analysis will be populated after impl work.
- Loc patterns are highly systematic — once you identify one category of bug, search for all instances across the parser.
- The value of this worker is in preventing future Loc regressions by codifying patterns into prevention rules and adversarial tests.
