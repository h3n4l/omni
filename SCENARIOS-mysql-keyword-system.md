# MySQL Parser Keyword System Alignment Scenarios

> Goal: Fully align omni's keyword classification and identifier parsing with MySQL 8.0's grammar (sql_yacc.yy) — 6-category keyword system, 5 context-dependent identifier functions, zero eqFold workarounds for registered keywords
> Verification: `go test ./mysql/parser/... -count=1` + oracle corpus tests
> Reference sources: mysql-server sql/sql_yacc.yy (grammar), sql/lex.h (keyword definitions), MySQL 8.0 docs

Status: [ ] pending, [x] passing, [~] partial

---

## Phase 1: Keyword Infrastructure

Build the 6-category keyword classification system and register all MySQL 8.0 keywords.

### 1.1 Keyword Classification Data Structure

Define the 6-category system matching MySQL's sql_yacc.yy:

- [x] Keywords have a category attribute: reserved, unambiguous, ambiguous_1, ambiguous_2, ambiguous_3, ambiguous_4
- [x] `isReserved(tokenType)` returns true only for reserved keywords
- [x] `isIdentKeyword(tokenType)` returns true for all 5 non-reserved categories (unambiguous + ambiguous 1-4)
- [x] `isLabelKeyword(tokenType)` returns true for unambiguous + ambiguous_3 + ambiguous_4 (excludes ambiguous_1, ambiguous_2)
- [x] `isRoleKeyword(tokenType)` returns true for unambiguous + ambiguous_2 + ambiguous_4 (excludes ambiguous_1, ambiguous_3)
- [x] `isLvalueKeyword(tokenType)` returns true for unambiguous + ambiguous_1 + ambiguous_2 + ambiguous_3 (excludes ambiguous_4)
- [x] All existing tests still pass — classification is additive, does not change behavior yet

### 1.2 Register Reserved Keywords — Core SQL

Register MySQL 8.0 reserved keywords missing from lexer. These are words declared WITHOUT `<lexer.keyword>` type tag in sql_yacc.yy.

- [x] Register `accessible` (reserved)
- [x] Register `asensitive` (reserved)
- [x] Register `cube` (reserved)
- [x] Register `cume_dist` (reserved)
- [x] Register `dense_rank` (reserved)
- [x] Register `dual` (reserved)
- [x] Register `first_value` (reserved)
- [x] Register `grouping` (reserved)
- [x] Register `insensitive` (reserved)
- [x] Register `lag` (reserved)
- [x] Register `last_value` (reserved)
- [x] Register `lead` (reserved)
- [x] Register `nth_value` (reserved)
- [x] Register `ntile` (reserved)
- [x] Register `of` (reserved)
- [x] Register `optimizer_costs` (reserved)
- [x] Register `percent_rank` (reserved)
- [x] Register `rank` (reserved)
- [x] Register `row_number` (reserved)
- [x] Register `sensitive` (reserved)
- [x] Register `specific` (reserved)
- [x] Register `usage` (reserved)
- [x] Register `varying` (reserved)
- [x] All newly registered words lex as keyword tokens, not tokIDENT

### 1.3 Register Reserved Keywords — Compound Interval & Temporal

- [x] Register `day_hour` (reserved)
- [x] Register `day_microsecond` (reserved)
- [x] Register `day_minute` (reserved)
- [x] Register `day_second` (reserved)
- [x] Register `hour_microsecond` (reserved)
- [x] Register `hour_minute` (reserved)
- [x] Register `hour_second` (reserved)
- [x] Register `minute_microsecond` (reserved)
- [x] Register `minute_second` (reserved)
- [x] Register `second_microsecond` (reserved)
- [x] Register `year_month` (reserved)
- [x] Register `utc_date` (reserved)
- [x] Register `utc_time` (reserved)
- [x] Register `utc_timestamp` (reserved)
- [x] Register `maxvalue` (reserved)
- [x] Register `no_write_to_binlog` (reserved)
- [x] Register `io_after_gtids` (reserved)
- [x] Register `io_before_gtids` (reserved)
- [x] Register `sqlexception` (reserved)
- [x] Register `sqlstate` (reserved)
- [x] Register `sqlwarning` (reserved)
- [x] INTERVAL expressions still work with keyword tokens as unit names
- [x] UTC functions still work when lexed as keyword tokens

## Phase 2: Identifier Context Functions

Create context-dependent identifier parsing functions and migrate all call sites.

### 2.1 Identifier Function Variants

Create 5 identifier parsing functions matching MySQL's grammar hierarchy.

- [x] `parseIdent()` — accepts tokIDENT + all 5 non-reserved keyword categories (ident rule)
- [x] `parseLabelIdent()` — accepts tokIDENT + unambiguous + ambiguous_3 + ambiguous_4 (label_ident rule)
- [x] `parseRoleIdent()` — accepts tokIDENT + unambiguous + ambiguous_2 + ambiguous_4 (role_ident rule)
- [x] `parseLvalueIdent()` — accepts tokIDENT + unambiguous + ambiguous_1 + ambiguous_2 + ambiguous_3 (lvalue_ident rule)
- [x] `parseKeywordOrIdent()` — accepts tokIDENT + ANY keyword token (for option values, enum values, action words)
- [x] Existing `parseIdentifier()` becomes an alias for `parseIdent()` (gradual migration)
- [x] `parseTableRef()` and `parseColumnRef()` use `parseIdent()` internally
- [x] `isIdentToken()` updated to match `parseIdent()` semantics
- [x] All existing tests still pass after function creation (no call site changes yet)

- [x] `label1: BEGIN ... END label1` with label1=`begin` rejected — BEGIN not allowed as label
- [x] All compound statement tests still pass

### 2.6 Migrate Role Ident Call Sites

- [ ] All SET tests still pass

### 2.8 Migrate Any-Keyword Call Sites — DDL Options

- [ ] INTERVAL unit uses parseKeywordOrIdent (accepts compound units like DAY_HOUR as keyword tokens)
- [ ] INTERVAL unit validation still works with keyword tokens (not just strings)
- [ ] All expression tests still pass

### 3.8 Completeness Audit

- [ ] Every MySQL 8.0 keyword in sql_yacc.yy that appears in omni's parser is registered as a keyword token
- [ ] Every registered keyword has the correct 6-category classification matching sql_yacc.yy
- [ ] Zero eqFold calls remain for strings that are registered keywords
- [ ] eqFold calls only remain for: (a) non-keyword compound option strings (key_block_size, max_rows, replication options, etc.), (b) option-name dispatch patterns in create_table.go where post-parse string matching is used, (c) `@@`-prefixed variable scope parsing in name.go (lexer emits `@@global.var` as single token)
- [ ] Oracle corpus: `CREATE TABLE select (a INT)` correctly rejected
- [ ] Oracle corpus: `CREATE TABLE t (select INT)` correctly rejected
- [ ] Oracle corpus: `CREATE TABLE t (rank INT)` correctly rejected (rank is reserved)
- [ ] Oracle corpus: `CREATE TABLE t (status INT)` correctly accepted (status is non-reserved)
- [ ] Oracle corpus: `CREATE TABLE begin (a INT)` correctly accepted (begin is ambiguous_2, allowed as ident)
- [ ] Full test suite passes with zero regressions
