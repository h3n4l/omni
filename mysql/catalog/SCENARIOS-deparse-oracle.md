# MySQL Deparser Oracle Verification Scenarios

> Goal: Comprehensive end-to-end oracle testing of the MySQL deparser against real MySQL 8.0 SHOW CREATE VIEW output
> Verification: Create views on both MySQL 8.0 (testcontainers) and omni catalog, compare SELECT body from SHOW CREATE VIEW
> Reference: Real MySQL 8.0 output is authoritative
> Notes: (1) Oracle mismatches may require deparser fixes — tracked inline. (2) INTERSECT/EXCEPT require MySQL 8.0.31+. (3) Recursive CTEs and correlated subqueries may hit parser limitations — mark [~] if so.

[ ] `SELECT a + b AS sum_col FROM t` — expression with explicit alias
[ ] `SELECT 1 FROM t` — literal auto-alias
[ ] `SELECT * FROM t` — star expansion (all columns listed)
[ ] `SELECT t1.a, t2.a FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.a` — same-name columns from different tables
```

## Phase 6: Subqueries & CTEs

### 6.1 Subquery Patterns

```
[ ] `SELECT (SELECT MAX(a) FROM t) FROM t` — scalar subquery in SELECT
[ ] `SELECT * FROM t WHERE a IN (SELECT a FROM t WHERE a > 0)` — IN subquery
[ ] `SELECT * FROM t WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE a > 0)` — EXISTS subquery
[ ] `SELECT a, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t t2 WHERE t2.a = t1.a) FROM t t1` — correlated subquery
[ ] `SELECT * FROM t WHERE a IN (SELECT a FROM t WHERE b IN (SELECT b FROM t WHERE c > 0))` — nested subqueries (2 levels)
```

### 6.2 CTE Patterns

```
[ ] `WITH cte AS (SELECT a FROM t) SELECT * FROM cte` — simple CTE
[ ] `WITH cte(x) AS (SELECT a FROM t) SELECT x FROM cte` — CTE with column list
[ ] `WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT n + 1 FROM cte WHERE n < 10) SELECT * FROM cte` — recursive CTE
[ ] `WITH c1 AS (SELECT a FROM t), c2 AS (SELECT b FROM t) SELECT c1.a, c2.b FROM c1, c2` — multiple CTEs
[ ] `WITH cte AS (SELECT a FROM t) SELECT * FROM cte UNION SELECT * FROM cte` — CTE used in UNION
```

## Phase 7: Window Functions

### 7.1 Window Function Patterns

```
[ ] `SELECT a, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY a) FROM t` — basic window
[ ] `SELECT a, SUM(b) OVER (PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b) FROM t` — PARTITION BY + ORDER BY
[ ] `SELECT a, SUM(b) OVER (PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) FROM t` — ROWS frame
[ ] `SELECT a, AVG(b) OVER (ORDER BY a RANGE BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) FROM t` — RANGE frame
[ ] `SELECT a, RANK() OVER w, DENSE_RANK() OVER w FROM t WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY a)` — named window
[ ] `SELECT a, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY a), SUM(b) OVER (ORDER BY a) FROM t` — multiple window functions
[ ] `SELECT a, LAG(a, 1) OVER (ORDER BY a), LEAD(a, 1) OVER (ORDER BY a) FROM t` — LAG/LEAD
```

## Phase 8: Edge Cases & Advanced

### 8.1 View-of-View & Complex Structures

```
[ ] View referencing another view: `CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT a FROM t; CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT * FROM v1`
[ ] View with 10+ columns: `SELECT a, b, c, a+1, b+1, c+1, a*b, b*c, a*c, a+b+c FROM t`
[ ] View with reserved word aliases: `SELECT a AS `select`, b AS `from`, c AS `where` FROM t`
[ ] View with CASE without ELSE: `SELECT CASE WHEN a > 0 THEN 'pos' WHEN a < 0 THEN 'neg' END FROM t`
[ ] View with BETWEEN using column bounds: `SELECT a BETWEEN b AND c FROM t`
```

### 8.2 Expression Edge Cases & Stress Tests

```
[ ] `SELECT CAST(a + b AS CHAR) FROM t` — CAST with expression (not just column)
[ ] `SELECT a COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci FROM t` — COLLATE expression
[ ] `SELECT INTERVAL 1 DAY + a FROM t` — INTERVAL arithmetic
[ ] `SELECT a SOUNDS LIKE b FROM t` — SOUNDS LIKE operator
[ ] `SELECT -a, +a FROM t` — unary operators (minus preserved, plus dropped)
[ ] Long expression auto-alias: `SELECT CASE WHEN a > 0 THEN CONCAT(a, b, c) WHEN a < 0 THEN CONCAT(c, b, a) ELSE NULL END FROM t` — Name_exp_N pattern
[ ] Reserved word as column name: `SELECT a FROM t` where column is named `select` (table has reserved word column)
[ ] `SELECT a + b, NOT (a > 0), CAST(a AS CHAR), COUNT(*), a REGEXP 'x' FROM t GROUP BY a, b HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` — multiple rewrites in one view
[ ] `SELECT a AND b, a OR b, NOT a, a XOR b, !a FROM t` — all logical operators with wrapping
[ ] `SELECT IFNULL(a, 0) AND COALESCE(b, 0) FROM t` — function results in boolean context
[ ] `SELECT (a > 0) AND (b + 1) OR (c IS NULL) FROM t` — mixed boolean/non-boolean precedence
```
