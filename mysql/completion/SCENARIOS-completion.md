# MySQL SQL Autocompletion Scenarios

> Goal: Implement parser-native SQL autocompletion for MySQL, matching PG's architecture — parser instrumentation with collectMode, completion module with Complete(sql, cursor, catalog) API
> Verification: Table-driven Go tests — Complete(sql, cursorPos, catalog) returns expected candidates with correct types
> Reference: PG completion system (pg/completion/, pg/parser/complete.go)
> Out of scope (v1): XA transactions, SHUTDOWN, RESTART, CLONE, INSTALL/UNINSTALL PLUGIN, IMPORT TABLE, BINLOG, CACHE INDEX, PURGE BINARY LOGS, CHANGE REPLICATION, START/STOP REPLICA

## Phase 1: Parser Completion Infrastructure

### 1.1 Completion Mode Fields & Entry Point

```
[x] Parser struct has completion fields: completing bool, cursorOff int, candidates *CandidateSet, collecting bool, maxCollect int
[x] collectMode() returns true when completing && collecting
[x] checkCursor() sets collecting=true when p.cur.Loc >= cursorOff
[x] CandidateSet struct with Tokens []int, Rules []RuleCandidate, seen/seenR dedup maps
[x] RuleCandidate struct with Rule string (e.g., "columnref", "table_ref")
[x] addTokenCandidate(tokType int) adds to CandidateSet.Tokens with dedup
[x] addRuleCandidate(rule string) adds to CandidateSet.Rules with dedup
[x] Collect(sql string, cursorOffset int) *CandidateSet — entry point with panic recovery
[x] Collect returns non-nil CandidateSet even for empty input
[x] Collect returns keyword candidates at statement start position: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.
[x] All existing parser tests pass with completion fields present (completing=false) — regression gate
```

### 1.2 Basic Keyword Collection

```
[x] Empty input → keyword candidates for all top-level statements
[x] After semicolon → keyword candidates for new statement
[x] `SELECT |` → keyword candidates for select expressions (DISTINCT, ALL) + rule candidates (columnref, func_name)
[x] `CREATE |` → keyword candidates for object types (TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, DATABASE, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, TRIGGER, EVENT)
[x] `ALTER |` → keyword candidates (TABLE, DATABASE, VIEW, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, EVENT)
[x] `DROP |` → keyword candidates (TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, DATABASE, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, TRIGGER, EVENT, IF)
```

## Phase 2: Completion Module (API & Resolution)

Build the public API and candidate resolution before instrumenting grammar rules,
so that Phase 3+ instrumentation can be tested end-to-end.

### 2.1 Public API & Core Logic

```
[x] Complete(sql, cursorOffset, catalog) returns []Candidate
[x] Candidate struct has Text, Type, Definition, Comment fields
[x] CandidateType enum: Keyword, Database, Table, View, Column, Function, Procedure, Index, Trigger, Event, Variable, Charset, Engine, Type
[x] Complete with nil catalog returns keyword-only candidates
[x] Complete with empty sql returns top-level statement keywords
[x] Prefix filtering: `SEL|` matches SELECT keyword
[x] Prefix filtering is case-insensitive
[x] Deduplication: same candidate not returned twice
```

### 2.2 Candidate Resolution

```
[x] Token candidates → keyword strings (from token type mapping)
[x] "table_ref" rule → catalog tables + views
[x] "columnref" rule → columns from tables in scope
[x] "database_ref" rule → catalog databases
[x] "function_ref" / "func_name" rule → catalog functions + built-in function names
[x] "procedure_ref" rule → catalog procedures
[x] "index_ref" rule → indexes from relevant table
[x] "trigger_ref" rule → catalog triggers
[x] "event_ref" rule → catalog events
[x] "view_ref" rule → catalog views
[x] "charset" rule → known charset names (utf8mb4, latin1, utf8, ascii, binary)
[x] "engine" rule → known engine names (InnoDB, MyISAM, MEMORY, CSV, ARCHIVE)
[x] "type_name" rule → MySQL type keywords (INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, BLOB, DATE, etc.)
```

### 2.3 Table Reference Extraction

```
[x] Extract table refs from simple SELECT: `SELECT * FROM t` → [{Table: "t"}]
[x] Extract table refs with alias: `SELECT * FROM t AS x` → [{Table: "t", Alias: "x"}]
[x] Extract table refs from JOIN: `FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON ...` → [{Table: "t1"}, {Table: "t2"}]
[x] Extract table refs with database: `FROM db.t` → [{Database: "db", Table: "t"}]
[x] Extract table refs from subquery: inner tables don't leak to outer scope
[x] Extract table refs from UPDATE: `UPDATE t SET ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
[x] Extract table refs from INSERT: `INSERT INTO t ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
[x] Extract table refs from DELETE: `DELETE FROM t ...` → [{Table: "t"}]
[x] Fallback to lexer-based extraction when AST parsing fails (incomplete SQL)
```

### 2.4 Tricky Completion (Fallback)

```
[x] Incomplete SQL: `SELECT * FROM ` (trailing space) → insert placeholder, re-collect
[x] Truncated mid-keyword: `SELE` → prefix-filter against keywords
[x] Truncated after comma: `SELECT a,` → insert placeholder column
[x] Truncated after operator: `WHERE a >` → insert placeholder expression
[x] Multiple placeholder strategies tried in order
[x] Fallback returns best-effort results when no strategy succeeds
[x] Placeholder insertion does not corrupt the candidate set from the initial pass
```

## Phase 9: Integration Tests

### 9.1 Multi-Table Schema Tests

```
[ ] Column completion scoped to correct table in JOIN: `SELECT t1.| FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON ...` → only t1 columns
[ ] Column completion from all tables when unqualified: `SELECT | FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON ...` → columns from both tables
[ ] Table alias completion: `SELECT x.| FROM t AS x` → columns of t via alias x
[ ] View column completion: `SELECT | FROM v` → columns of view v

```

### 9.2 Edge Cases

```
[ ] Cursor at beginning of SQL: `|SELECT * FROM t` → top-level keywords
[ ] Cursor in middle of identifier: `SELECT us|ers FROM t` → prefix "us" filters candidates
[ ] Cursor after semicolon (multi-statement): `SELECT 1; SELECT |` → new statement context
[ ] Empty SQL: `|` → top-level keywords
[ ] Whitespace only: `   |` → top-level keywords
[ ] Very long SQL with cursor in middle
[ ] SQL with syntax errors before cursor: completion still works for valid prefix
[ ] Backtick-quoted identifiers: `SELECT \`| FROM t` → column candidates
```

### 9.3 Complex SQL Patterns

```
[ ] Nested subquery column completion: `SELECT * FROM t WHERE a IN (SELECT | FROM t2)` → t2 columns
[ ] Correlated subquery: `SELECT *, (SELECT | FROM t2 WHERE t2.a = t1.a) FROM t1` → t2 columns
[ ] UNION: `SELECT a FROM t1 UNION SELECT | FROM t2` → t2 columns
[ ] Multiple JOINs: `SELECT | FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON ... JOIN t3 ON ...` → columns from all 3 tables
[ ] INSERT ... SELECT: `INSERT INTO t1 SELECT | FROM t2` → t2 columns
[ ] Complex ALTER: `ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT fk FOREIGN KEY (|) REFERENCES ...` → t columns
```
